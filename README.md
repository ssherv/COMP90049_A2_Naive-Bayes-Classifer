# COMP90049_A2_Naive-Bayes-Classifer
Implemented (by hand) a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier with episolon smoothing, which was applied to various classification datasets. Explored evaluation paradigms as well as the impact of individual features on classification performance. 

<h4> Completed in September 2022 (Semester 2)</h4>

  <li><b>A2_specification:</b> The instruction document which includes an explanation of the assignment and the structure of the program to be written </li>
  <li><b>nb_classifier:</b> My solution to this assignment - written as a jupyter notebook. Includes an implementation of the NB classifer from scratch (without existing libraries). This implementation utilised epsilon smoothing to counteract unobserved data. The NB classifer was applied to 3 classification datasets, and the results evaluated and analysed. As part of the analysis, a One-R baseline model and a K-Fold Cross Validation strategy was implemented for comparison. Conceptual questions about Naive Bayes and feature selection is also included.</li>

  <li><b>bank-marketing.csv:</b> predict if a client will subscribe a term deposit depending on a number of personal and financial features such as job, education level, housing loan, etc. </li>
  <li><b>obesity.csv:</b> predict whether a patient is obese or not based on various personal and habitual attributes such as alcohol consumption, exercise level, gender, etc </li>
  <li><b>student.csv:</b> predict a student’s final grade fA+, A, B, C, D, Fg based on a number of personal and performance related attributes, such as school, parent’s education level, number of absences, etc. </li>
